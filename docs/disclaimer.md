# Moony Labs LLC Disclaimer

## 1. General Disclaimer

This documentation is provided for informational and educational purposes only. It does not constitute financial, investment, legal, tax, or any other form of professional advice. Nothing contained herein should be interpreted as a recommendation, solicitation, or endorsement to acquire, hold, use, or dispose of any digital asset, or to engage in any particular transaction or strategy.

Use of this documentation or interaction with any blockchain-based system is voluntary and undertaken entirely at the user's own risk. Users are encouraged to conduct independent research, seek qualified professional advice, and exercise caution when engaging with decentralized technologies.

## 2. Moony Protocol Overview

Moony is a decentralized protocol and associated digital asset governed by an immutable smart contract deployed on the Solana blockchain.

Once published on-chain, the protocol operates autonomously according to its code. It is self-executing, permissionless, and not dependent on any company, organization, or individual for its operation. No representation is made that the protocol will perform as intended, maintain any particular value, or achieve any specific outcome.

---

## 3. Moony Labs' Role

Moony Labs, LLC deployed the Moony protocol as open, permissionless digital public infrastructure. Its involvement is intentionally limited and defined as follows.

### Deployment Only

Moony Labs' sole role was the initial publication of the protocol on-chain. The protocol was not created to operate as a company product, nor to remain under the control, direction, or discretion of its deploying entity.

### No Ownership or Economic Participation

Moony Labs does not hold any allocation of the MNY token supply, does not receive proceeds from the reserve contract, and does not participate in the economic flows of the protocol. The protocol was published without venture financing, token pre-sales, equity issuance, or investor-linked performance expectations.

### No Control or Authority

Following deployment, Moony Labs does not control token supply, operate privileged keys, retain upgrade authority, or possess any ability to modify, pause, upgrade, or otherwise interfere with the protocol. There are no administrative controls, backdoors, or retained permissions.

### No Ongoing Operations

Moony Labs does not operate the network, manage communities, conduct marketing, provide financial services, collect user data, issue grants, or coordinate ecosystem activity. It does not act as a governing authority or centralized steward of the protocol.

### No Future Obligations

No ongoing development, maintenance, promotion, or stewardship is promised or implied. The protocol does not depend on continued involvement by Moony Labs to exist, function, or grow.

This structure is intentional. By relinquishing ongoing control and responsibility, Moony Labs ensures that Moony exists as neutral public infrastructure, free to evolve through the independent actions of its participants rather than centralized coordination.

- Irreversible transactions and permanent loss of assets
- Changes in applicable laws, regulations, or enforcement priorities
