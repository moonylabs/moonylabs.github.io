# Disclaimer

This documentation is provided for informational and educational purposes only. It does not constitute financial, investment, legal, tax, or any other form of advice. Moony is a decentralized protocol and digital asset governed by an immutable smart contract on the Solana blockchain. The protocol operates autonomously and cannot be altered, controlled, or influenced by any party after deployment. No company, organization, or individual is responsible for Moony's performance, value, or outcomes. Participants engage with the Moony protocol at their own risk and are strongly encouraged to conduct independent research, seek professional advice, and exercise caution when interacting with blockchain-based systems.

## Moony Labs' Role

Moony Labs, LLC deployed the Moony protocol as open, permissionless digital public infrastructure. From the moment the protocol was published on-chain, it became an autonomous system that anyone may use, study, integrate, extend, or build upon without permission. The protocol was not created to be operated as a company product, nor to remain under the control, direction, or discretion of its deploying entity. Rather, its design assumes independence from the outset, with the deployment itself serving as Moony Labs' sole foundational contribution to the network.

Prior to deployment, Moony Labs did not conduct a funding round, issue equity, sell allocations, or enter into contractual obligations tied to the future performance of the protocol. It published Moony without venture financing, token pre-sales, or investor-linked performance expectations. Moony Labs does not hold any allocation of the MNY token supply, does not receive proceeds from the reserve contract, and does not participate in the economic flows of the system. It does not financially benefit from the adoption, use, or market activity of MNY in any form. The protocol was published without a retained stake.

Following deployment, Moony Labs does not participate in the ongoing operation of the network. It does not control token supply, operate privileged keys, or retain any capacity to modify, pause, upgrade, or otherwise interfere with the protocol. The Moony protocol is fully immutable and self-executing from the moment it is published. There are no backdoors, no administrative controls, and no upgrade authorities.

This separation is not an absence of responsibility. It is the mechanism by which Moony becomes neutral. By relinquishing ongoing control, Moony Labs ensures that Moony does not derive its legitimacy, direction, or economic behavior from any single organization. The network is free to evolve through the independent actions of its participants rather than through centralized coordination.

To support transparency and reproducibility, moonylabs.com points to the public GitHub repositories and technical documentation associated with the original deployment. These resources exist as an open reference for developers, researchers, and builders. While Moony Labs may continue to host these materials for as long as it reasonably can, they are fundamentally part of the open commons. Anyone is free to mirror, archive, or fork them at any time.

At present, Moony Labs does not conduct marketing, community management, ecosystem coordination, protocol governance, or financial services. It does not operate social media accounts, collect user data, issue grants, or act as a governing authority. Its non-operational posture reflects a deliberate design choice to ensure that no ongoing managerial effort is required for Moony to exist, grow, or function.

This structure ensures that Moony does not depend on continued performance, promotion, or stewardship from its publisher. No future development, maintenance, marketing, or economic return is promised or implied. From the moment of publication, Moony exists as a permissionless public good. Its value, culture, and long-term trajectory are shaped not by Moony Labs, but by the broader community of developers, users, educators, businesses, and independent contributors who choose to participate in its ecosystem.

## No Warranties or Guarantees

Moony Labs makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, regarding the Moony protocol, including but not limited to its fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, security, or non-infringement. The protocol is provided "as is" and "as available." Users assume all risks associated with interacting with blockchain technology, including potential loss of funds, smart contract vulnerabilities, network congestion, or regulatory changes. Moony Labs shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from use of the protocol or this documentation.

## Risks of Blockchain Interaction

Blockchain technology, including the Solana network and the Moony protocol, involves inherent risks such as volatility, technical failures, cyberattacks, and irreversible transactions. Users should be aware that digital assets like MNY may fluctuate in value or become worthless. Participation is at your own risk, and Moony Labs disclaims all liability for losses or damages.

## Open-Source Nature

The Moony protocol is open-source software licensed under [insert license, e.g., MIT or Apache 2.0]. While Moony Labs deployed the initial version, the code is available for inspection, forking, or modification by anyone. No guarantees are made regarding third-party implementations or forks.

## Updates to This Disclaimer

Moony Labs reserves the right to update this disclaimer at any time. Changes will be posted on this page with the updated date. Continued use of the documentation or protocol constitutes acceptance of any modifications.
