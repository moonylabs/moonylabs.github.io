# Micropayments

Micropayments, transactions valued in cents or fractions of a cent, have historically been impractical under legacy financial rails. Percentage‑based fees, multi‑day settlement cycles, and reliance on centralized intermediaries make low‑value transfers uneconomical, cutting off entire categories of digital commerce. 

These limitations have forced creators, developers, and small businesses into centralized platforms that aggregate payments, take substantial fees, and control audience relationships. Moony removes these barriers. Built for high‑volume, low‑value transactions, it combines extreme divisibility with near‑zero fees to make micropayments viable at a global scale. By doing so, it unlocks entirely new economic behaviors that were previously impossible or uneconomical.

## Why It Matters

Micropayments are not simply smaller versions of ordinary transactions, they are a missing building block of the modern internet economy. The inability to move tiny amounts of value efficiently has shaped the digital landscape in ways that limit innovation and inclusion:

- **Centralization**: Without cost‑effective direct payment rails, creators and small businesses are forced into platforms that bundle transactions, take large fees, and control access to audiences.

- **Subscriptions**: The impracticality of per‑use billing forces consumers into subscription models, paying for more than they actually use.

- **Bottlenecks**: Entire categories of applications, such as real‑time metering, per‑unit API calls, or machine‑to‑machine commerce, remain underdeveloped because payment systems cannot handle the volume or economics they require.

## Moony's Advantage

Moony’s architecture is purpose‑built to make micropayments economically viable at global scale. The token’s extreme divisibility allows transactions measured in fractions of a cent, ideal for tipping, micro‑rewards, metered services, and other fine‑grained use cases. 

Every transfer settles on the Solana blockchain with trust‑minimized execution and irreversible finality, eliminating reliance on banks, processors, or escrow services. Solana’s high‑throughput design keeps fees to a fraction of a cent and confirms transactions in seconds, free from banking hours or remittance corridors. Low fees are the foundation that make real‑time, granular monetization possible, enabling sustainable small‑value transfers that expand markets, drive innovation, and open the digital economy to all.

## Potential Applications

Moony’s micropayment capabilities enable a wide range of practical and programmable economic models:

Micropayments with Moony open the door to innovative digital and physical interactions, including:

- **Pay-Per-Use:** Unlock content, articles, videos, or AI tools for pennies without recurring subscriptions.
- **In-App Purchase:** Purchase digital items, upgrades, or event access without credit card integrations.
- **Streaming Payments:** Transfer value continuously in real time for services like media consumption or cloud computing.
- **M2M Commerce:** Automate exchange of bandwidth, energy, or data in precise micro‑increments.
- **Direct Support:** Send low‑fee micro‑tips to artists, streamers, or writers without intermediary platform fees.

By combining scarce, divisible digital cash with low‑cost, high‑throughput settlement, Moony turns micropayments from an abstract ideal into a practical, composable building block for a decentralized, internet‑native economy.
